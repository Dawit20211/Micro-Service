# Micro-Service

Trail Microservice API

I have developed a RESTful API for interacting with a database in my trial micro-service project using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. For the three tables USER, TRAIL, and LOCATION, I have implemented CRUD operations. Each table's controllers manage HTTP requests and communicate with the database using the proper async methods, such as FindAsync, AddAsync, and SaveChangesAsync. I also correctly handled user ids and handle HTTP status codes. By simulating various user interactions, generating test cases, and checking the CRUD operations with various test data and scenarios, i manually tested the API using Postman.
